# The-Book-App
this app shows a list of different books showing their basic infomation like the author, a link to the authors original site or where they can buy the books from. this app also allows the user to put books in different categories in order to track their readings such as adding the book to a wishlist or marking the book as already read or already purchased(this feature will be in the future updates).

the application does not use any remote or loacal database storage at the moment. eventually this would be added to the app in future
